There seem to be more high predictions for yes than for left

We'll test:

00176480_nohash_0.wav, left, 0.959 <-- High accuracy
0137b3f4_nohash_3.wav, left, 0.903 <-- High accuracy
035de8fe_nohash_0.wav, left, 0.999 <-- High accuracy


left 
/lɛft/

l: 
F2 lightly upwards transition to ɛ
F3 sightly downwards transition to ɛ
F4 sightly more downwards transition to ɛ
l is captured in F1, F4 and F5

ɛ-f:
F1-F4 very slightly downwards to f
f activated in mostly F1, F4, F5
unclear formant lines with low energy

f-t:
silence after f, silence-t afterwards
t activated in all formants
unclear formant lines with low energy

00176480_nohash_0	male
1: F1 and F2 lightly. Highly activates from 400-500 which is noise.
   Activation near 500 ms is the transition l-ɛ. 
   Also activates a very small part in ɛ and in f.
   1. Upward formant line activation again in F1.
2: F1 + F2 lightly. High activation from 650-800 ms. Matches ɛ-f transition: last part of ɛ and first part of f
   Unlike yes, the captured formant line is not horizontal. Captures ɛ but also clearly f this time
   1. Captures vowels and vowel to consonant transition (atleast ɛ-f, or ɛ to a fricative)

0137b3f4_nohash_3	male
1: F1. Activation near 350 ms is noise.
   High activation from 400-470 ms, corresponds to l-ɛ.
   1. Upward formant line activation F1.
2: F1. Activation blob in 600-800 ms. Matches ɛ-f transition
   Highly activated part is between 600-650 ms at 700-800 Hz and matches ɛ.
   1. Vowel detector (ɛ / 700-800 Hz) but also activates in the transition.

Weird that this gets 0.999
Maybe an error, or l (or left recording) is always preceded by characteristic noise
1:	F1. High activation between 200-300 ms is noise. Low activation between 400-500 ms is l-ɛ.
	Filter by itself seems not robust to noise.
	1. Still matches upward formant lines.
2:	Activates only a pattern in the noise. Filter by itself seems not robust to noise.
	1. Vowel not captured
